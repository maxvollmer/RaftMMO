0.4.1-alpha
* Improved detection of free ocean space for meetups
* Fixed RaftMMO player counter only counting players who have their menu open.
* Added dedicated status tab in RaftMMO menu that shows number of RaftMMO players and your current meetup status

0.4.0-alpha
* The buoys are dead, long live the buoy!
   Completely reworked how meeting other rafts works. There are no more random buoys spawning in the ocean.
   You don't have to sail to a certain location to meet up. Instead, if there is enough space in the nearby ocean
   for a meetup, and another player is also able to meet, you will connect and a buoy will spawn to mark the meeting spot.
   That means if you see a buoy, you are guaranteed another player, and if there are no other players, you won't see buoys.
* Added a counter in the menu that shows how many people are currently playing with RaftMMO.
* Added a global meeting cooldown of 1 minute, and a cooldown of 15 minutes per remote raft,
   to avoid running into the same remote raft again and again.
* Small performance improvements.
* Improved how favorited rafts are prioritized.
* Improved distance detection between islands and potential meetup points.
* Fixed a rare NullReference exception in the receiver patch.
